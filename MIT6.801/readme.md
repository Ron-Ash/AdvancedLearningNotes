This course delves into Physics Based Machine Vision, a branch of computer vision; which formulates image formation processes from original 3D worlds to 2D images using physics, optics and mathematics, and then to rigorously solve the inverse equations of these processes for recovering the original 3D worlds from given 2D images.
