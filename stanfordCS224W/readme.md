Graphs are a general language for describing and analyzing entities with relations/interactions. There are many types of networks and graphs, such as social networks, communication and transaction networks, biomedine networks, brain networks, etc. Taking advantage of these relational structures for better prediction is done via Machine Learning with Graphs which this course covers.
