    "One of the fundamental problems of graph theory and computer science is the problem of counting the number of times a given subgraph appears within a larger parent graph. This problem can now be cast as a machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give a graph $G=(V,E)$, either: (the definition used depends on the domain of study)\n",
    "1. $G'$ is a subgraph of $G$ (node) *induced* by $V'$, where $G'=(V',E')$ such that $V'\\subseteq V$ and $E'=\\{(u,v)\\in E | u,v\\in V'\\}$\n",
    "2. $G'$ is a subgraph of $G$ (edge) *induced* by $E'$, where $G'=(V',E')$ such that $E'\\subseteq E$ and $V'=\\{v\\in V | (v,u)\\in E'\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, as these definitions require the subgraph to be taken from the original parent, *isomorphism* (whether graphs are identical - graph isomorphism has not been proven to be an NP-hard problem but no polynomial algorithm has been found) needs to be defined such that an un-related sugraph can be defined for a parent. $G_1=(V_1,E_1)$ amd $G_2=(V_2,E_2)$ are *isomorphic* if there exists a bijection (one-to-one) $f:V_1\\rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)\\in E_1 \\leftrightarrow (f(u),f(v))\\in E_2$ ($f$ is called the *isomorphism*). Therefore, $G_2$ is *subgraph-isomorphic* (known to be NP-hard) to $G_1$ if some subgraph of $G_2$ is *isomorphic* to $G_1$ (commonly say $G_1$ is a subgraph of $G_2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Network Motifs*** are recurring (high frequency), significant (more frequent than expected) patterns (small subgraphs) of interconnections. *Network Motifs* are important as they help in teh understanding of how the graph dataset works (e.g. feed-forward loops motifs found in networks of neurons were found to be used for neutralising \"biological noise\", etc.) and are a useful tool to make predictions based on their (lack of) presence in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subgraph frequency is defined by the number of nodes $u$ in $G_T$ for which some subgraph of $G_T$ is isomorphic to $G_Q$ and the isomorphism maps node $u$ to $v$. Let $(G_Q,v)$ be called a *node-anchored* subgraph (robust to outliers). Thus, is a subgraphs occurs in a real network more often than in a **random network** it is considered to have functional significance:\n",
    "- **Erdos-Renyi Random Graphs**: $G_{n,p}$ is an undirected graph on $n$ nodes where each edge $(u,v)$ appears independent and identically distributed with probability $p$.\n",
    "- **Configuration Model**: $G^{rand}$ is a random graph with given degree sequence $k_1,\\ldots,k_N$; generated by creating for each node $i$, $k_i$ mini-nodes and randomly connecting these mini-nodes (no self-loops), afterwhich coalescing back the mini-nodes, retaining their connections within the parent node (coalesce similar connections).\n",
    "\n",
    "And so to determine is *motifs* are overrepresented in a network can be done by statistical measures (z-score, etc.) to evaluate how significant is the difference between the *motif* count in the real graph vs the random graph with similar statistics (node number, edges, degree sequence, etc.) for each *motif*."
