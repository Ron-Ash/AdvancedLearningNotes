    "Like other programming languages, the `main` function is special; always being the first code that runs in every executable program (declared using `fn main() {}` as *Rust* requires curly brackers around all function bodies). `println!` calls a *Rust* marco (`!` specifies the use of a macro instead of a function); which are a way of writing code that generates other code to extend the *Rust* syntax. `;` is also used in *Rust* to end expressions.\n",

    "To create a project, `cargo new hello_cargo` is used; which creates a new directory of the name `hello_cargo` and initialises required files for cargo operations: a `Cargo.toml` file, a `src` directory wiht a `main.rs` file inside, as well as a new git repository along with a `.gitignore` file (will not be generated if ran within an existing git repository though behaviour can be overridden using `cargo new --vcs=git`).\n",

    "## Common Programming Concepts\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "Variables, declared using the `let` statement, are immutable by default. If one part of a script operates on the assumption that a value will never change and another part changes that value, its possible that the first part of the code will not do. Additionally, this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially when the second piece of code changes the value only sometimes; therefore the *Rust* compiler guarantees that when you state that a value will not change, it really will not change (easier to reason through). By adding `mut` in front of the variable name, the variable is made muutable (additionally conveys the intent to future readers of the code that other parts of the code will be changing this variable's value)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Shadowing*** is done by using the same variable's name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword to declare a new value. This is not making a variable mmutable, instead its overriding it with a new definition; allowing the change of type (will cause a compile-time error if attempted to be done with `mut`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants, declared using `const` prefix, define an always immutable value (cannot use `mut`). Further, their types must always be annotated, they can be declared in any scope (including the global scope); and most importantly, they may be set only to a constant expression - not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "*Rust* provides the standard scalr data types present in other programming languages such as integers (`i8`,`u8`,...,`i128`,`u128`), floating points (`f32`,`f64` and are all signed), boolean (`bool`), and character (`char`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, multiple of these can be grouped into one type using tuples. Tuples are fixed length and once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size; declared via `let tup: (i32, f64, bool) = (500, 6.4, true);`. Distrucuring a tuple can be done by `let (x, y, z) = tup;`, breaking the signle tuple into three parts; though an alternate method of accessing the elements can be done through directly indexing the tuple using `.` (`tup.0`, etc.). Similarly this tuple is immutable unless `mut` is added to the front of the `let`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array, though every element must have the same type unlike tuples; and like tuples, arrays in *Rust* have a fixed length. Arrays are declared as `let arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` and can be accessed using normal indexing, `arr[0]`. Unlike other programming languages like *C*, when ***indexing out-of-bounds***, *Rust* returns a runtime error and terminates program (will *panic*). This is a memory safety principle that prevents security vulnerabilities in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "Functions in *Rust* are defined (order of functions does not matter) by `fn` followed by the function name and a set of parentheses which include the paramenters (special variables that are part of a function's signature) with their type (type must be declared). Functions can return values to the code that calls them, and so the return type must be declared after an arrow (`->`) as a suffix to the parentheses. Most functions return the last expression implicitly (by not having a semicolon on the last expression), though an early return can be created using `return`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "Comments are either done using `//` for a single line comment, or `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Flow\n",
    "An `if` expression allows the branching of code dependening on different conditions, and with the ability chain them, `if number > 3 {...} else if munber < 3 {...} else {...}` (`else` is optional), allows for multiple conditions to be evaluated. It can also be used in a `let` statement, `let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };`, to define a variable (must have compatible types).\n",
    "\n",
    "`loop {}` executes a block of code repeatedly forever or until explicitly stopped using `return` or `break` (can return values from loop by placing an expression after either with or without a semicolon). `continue` causes the block of code to be repeated without completing the current iteration. Note that both `continue` and `break` apply to the innermost loop at that point, though a loop label can be optionally specified and used with those to `continue` and `break` on a specific loop. `while condition {}` executes a block of code repeatedly until the condition is met or explicitly stopped (similar to `loop`). `for element in arr {}` iterates through all elements in an array and executes a block of code with each element."
