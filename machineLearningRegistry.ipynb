The recursive splitting occurs where any given region $R_l'$ is partitioned based on a feature, $j$, and a threshold, $s$, resulting in two child regions $R_l(j,s)=\\{x|x_j<s\\}$ and $R_{\\bar{l}}(j,s)=\\{x|x_j\\geq s\\}$; their subsequent prediction values are then $\\hat{y_l}(j,s)=\\frac{1}{|R_l(j,s)|}\\sum_{x_i\\in R_l(j,s)}y_i$ (regression) or $\\hat{y_l}(j,s)=\\text{MajorityVote}\\{y_i:x_i\\in R_l(j,s)\\}$ (classification).

    "*XGBoost*, like other models, commonly use *target encoding* for categorical features; defining $\\hat{y}^{(k)}=\\mathbb{E}(y|x_i=x^{(k)}_i)$, the average target values over the training examples with the same categories. However, this is noisy for low-frequency targets and so it is usually smoothed using $x^{(k)}_i=\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^n\\mathbb{I}_{x^{(k)}_i=x^{(k)}_j}y_j+ap}{\\sum_{j=1}^n\\mathbb{I}_{x^{(k)}_i=x^{(k)}_j}+a}$ where $a>0$ is a pre-defined parameter, adn $p$ is a prior (global mean, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because feature $\\hat{x}^{(k)}_i$ is computed using $y_i$, as well as using 'future' records, these lead to a *conditional shift* (target leakage); where the distribution of $\\hat{x}^{(k)}|y$ differs between the training and testing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general method to avoid the first issue is defining a *Leave-One-Out* (LOO) subsets, $\\mathcal{D}_i\\sub\\mathcal{D}\\backslash \\{x_i\\}$, which exclude the given datapoint. This leads to the new definition $x^{(k)}_i=\\frac{\\sum_{x_j\\in\\mathcal{D}_i}\\mathbb{I}_{x^{(k)}_i=x^{(k)}_j}y_j+ap}{\\sum_{x_j\\in\\mathcal{D}_i}\\mathbb{I}_{x^{(k)}_i=x^{(k)}_j}+a}$. However, this leaves the use of 'future' records in the evaluation of the datapoint, and so conditional shift remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CatBoost* uses a more effective, *Ordered/Online*, strategy; generating $s+1$  idependent random permutations (random orderings) of the training dataset. Permutations $\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_s$ are used for evaluation of splits that define $s$ tree tructures (gradient computation), and thus stabilizes the estimates; while $\\sigma_0$ is used for obtaining th eleaf values of hte obtained trees.\n",

    "This mechanism allows for *Catboost* to natively and safely handle categorical and text-based features without requiring external preprocessing or encoding. In addition, CatBoost avoids the complex, arbitrarily-shaped trees used in algorithms like XGBoost. Instead, it uses *symmetric* (oblivious) trees, where all nodes at the same depth split on the same feature and threshold. This design offers efficient parallelisation due to the model's regular and predictable structure, as well as fast inference due to the constant depth procedures aligning with modern hardware architecture and behaviour."
