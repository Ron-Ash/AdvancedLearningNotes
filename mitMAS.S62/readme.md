Money is thought to have emerged as a solution to the *coincidence of wants* problem; where two parties must each have something the other wants at the same time and in the right quantity for a bartering system to succeed. Due to this inefficiency, a shared and agreed to *medium of exchange* is used to facilitate transactions irespective of a direct barter. 

Another theory pertains to money formalizing the right which the creditor acquires to "*payment*" and the obligation of the debtor to *pay* his debt. As well as the standardisation of "*payment*" such that the debtor has the right to release himself from his debt irespective of the creditor's personal preferences and is obligated to accept.

For the same reasons as traditional money cryptocurrencies have inherent monetary value and can be used in transactions around the world. This course then looks at the design of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and how they function in practice, focusing on cryptography, game theory, and network architecture.
